# CRM360 API Documentation

## Base URL
```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

## Authentication
All protected routes require a JWT token via httpOnly cookie. The server automatically handles token storage and retrieval.

**Note:** For cross-origin requests (e.g., from a frontend on a different domain), include `credentials: true` in your fetch/axios config.

**Fallback:** The server also accepts tokens in the Authorization header for backward compatibility:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Endpoints

### Auth

#### POST /auth/signup
Register a new user. New users are created as admins and must verify their email before logging in.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string",
  "full_name": "string"
}
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "User registered successfully. Check your email for a verification code.",
  "data": {
    "user": { "id", "email", "display_name", "role", "is_active", "created_at" }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Signup does not set an access token. Login sets an access token even when the email is not verified, with `crm_IV=false`, so the frontend can redirect the user to email verification.

---

#### POST /auth/verify-email
Verify a new user's email with the OTP sent during signup. A successful verification logs the user in.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "string",
  "otp": "string"
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Email verified successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": { "id", "email", "display_name", "avatar_url", "role", "created_at" }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Token is set via cookie automatically.

---

#### POST /auth/resend-verification-email
Resend the signup verification OTP for an unverified account.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "string"
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Verification code sent to your email"
}
```

**Response (429):**
```json
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Too many verification codes requested. Please try again later."
}
```

---

#### GET /auth/google
Get Google OAuth authorization URL for social login.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Auth URL generated successfully",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://accounts.google.com/oauth2/..."
  }
}
```

---

#### GET /auth/google/callback
Handle Google OAuth callback. Redirects to frontend with token.

---

#### POST /auth/login
Login with email and password. The server sets the access token cookie after valid credentials even if the email is not verified. For unverified users, `crm_IV=false` is set and the frontend should redirect to email verification.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "user": { "id", "email", "display_name", "avatar_url", "role", "organization_id", "is_verified", "created_at" }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Token is set via httpOnly `crm_AT` cookie automatically. Verification state is exposed via `crm_IV`.

---

#### GET /auth/me
Get current user profile. **Requires auth.**

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "User profile retrieved successfully",

}
```

  }
}
```
